            <div type="chapter" n="1">
                <head> I. The Elephant Man </head>
                <div type="paragraph" n="1">
                    <p>IN the <placeName sameAs="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q64163086">Mile End Road</placeName>, opposite to the <placeName sameAs="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7374421">London Hospital</placeName>, 
                        there was (and possibly still is) a line of small shops. Among them was a vacant greengrocer’s which was to let. 
                        The whole of the front of the shop, with the exception of the door, was hidden by a hanging sheet of canvas on which was 
                        the announcement that <persName ref="#Merrick">the Elephant Man</persName> was to be seen within and 
                        that the price of admission was twopence. Painted on the canvas in primitive colours was a 
                        life-size portrait of <persName ref="#Merrick">the Elephant Man</persName>. This very crude production 
                        depicted a frightful creature that could only have been possible in a nightmare. It was the figure of a man with the characteristics 
                        of an elephant. The transfiguration was not far advanced. There was still more of the man than of the beast. This fact—that it was 
                        still human—was the most repellent attribute of the creature. There was nothing about it of the pitiableness of the misshapened or 
                        the deformed, nothing of the grotesqueness of the freak, but merely the loathsome insinuation of a man being changed into an animal. 
                        Some palm trees in the background of the picture suggested a jungle and might have led the imaginative to assume that it was in this 
                        wild that the perverted object had roamed.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="paragraph" n="4">
                    <p>
                        The <persName ref="#Showman">Showman</persName>—speaking as if to a dog—called out harshly: <q>Stand up!</q>
                        The thing arose slowly and let the blanket that covered its  head and back fall to the ground. There stood revealed the most disgusting 
                        specimen of humanity that I have ever seen. In the course of my profession I had come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury 
                        or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body depending upon like causes; but at no time had I met with such a degraded or 
                        perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed. He was naked to the waist, his feet were bare, he wore a pair of threadbare 
                        trousers that had4 once belonged to some fat gentleman’s dress suit.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div type="paragraph" n="11">
                    <p>
                        The episode of <persName ref="#Merrick">the Elephant Man</persName> was, I imagined, closed; but I was fated to meet him again—<date when="1886">two years later</date>—under more dramatic conditions. 
                        In <placeName sameAs="https://www.geonames.org/6269131/england.html">England</placeName> the <persName ref="#Showman">showman</persName> and <persName ref="#Merrick">Merrick</persName> had been moved on from place to place by the police, who considered the exhibition degrading and among the things 
                        that could not be allowed. It was hoped that in the uncritical retreats of <placeName sameAs="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q64163086">Mile End</placeName> a more abiding peace would be found. But it was not to be. The official mind 
                        there, as elsewhere, very properly decreed that the public exposure of <persName ref="#Merrick">Merrick</persName> and his deformities transgressed the limits of decency. The show must close.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div type="paragraph" n="12">
                    <p>
                    The <persName ref="#Showman">showman</persName>, in despair, fled with his charge to the Continent. Whither he roamed at first I do not know; but he came finally to <placeName sameAs="https://www.geonames.org/2800866/brussels.html">Brussels</placeName>. His reception was discouraging. 
                    <placeName sameAs="https://www.geonames.org/2800866/brussels.html">Brussels</placeName> was firm; the exhibition was banned; it was brutal, indecent and immoral, and could not be permitted within the confines of <placeName sameAs="https://www.geonames.org/2802361/kingdom-of-belgium.html">Belgium</placeName>. 
                    <persName ref="#Merrick">Merrick</persName> was thus no longer of value. 
                    He was no longer a source of profitable entertainment. He was a burden. He must be got rid of. The elimination of <persName ref="#Merrick">Merrick</persName> was a simple matter. He could offer no resistance. 
                    He was as docile as a sick sheep. The impresario, having robbed <persName ref="#Merrick">Merrick</persName> of his paltry savings, gave him a ticket to <placeName sameAs="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/london.html">London</placeName>, saw him into the train and no doubt in parting condemned him to perdition.
                    </p>

                <div type="paragraph" n="56">
                    <p>
                        He often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep <q who="#Merrick">like other people.</q> I think on this last night he must, with some determination, 
                        have made the experiment. The pillow was soft, and the head, when placed on it, must have fallen backwards and caused a dislocation of the neck. 
                        Thus it came about that his death was due to the desire that had dominated his life—the pathetic but hopeless desire to be <q>like other people.</q>
